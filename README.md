It's pretty buggy, thinking of redoing the project :)

## Features
- User Authentication by Passport.js
- SWR Hooks
- Next.js framework

- TailwindCSS UI Design
- CRUD Operations for both Users and Appointments
- Email Verification
- Change Passwords
- Forgot Password


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Create an .env file containing your:
- MONGODB_URI
- DB_NAME
- CLOUDINARY_URL
- SENDGRID_API_KEY
- EMAIL_FROM (Host email for SendGrid)
- WEB_URI (http://localhost:3000 when running your dev server)

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
